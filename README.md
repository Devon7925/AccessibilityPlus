## About The Project

This project was started because I couldn't identify most blocks, I lost the ores when mining, I couldn't read the signs' text, I couldn't identify the items on my inventory because I play with a lot of zoom and couldn't read any enchantments because of the zoom.

This mod enhances the narrator functionality to easily identify the world around you and any inventory!

Features:
  * Read the block you are looking at.
  * Read the action bar text. Example: You can only sleep at night or during thunderstorms.
  * In any inventory when hovering over an item:
    * Read the amount of that item
    * Read the entire tooltip (item name, enchantments, custom text like book authors and server items).

I'm planning to add more sound cues and narratable text in the future to better identify the Minecraft world.

This mod helped me a lot when playing on servers because they use a lot of signs and custom text on their items.

## Getting Started

This mod is for Fabric, so you must install it before using this mod, it also requires a library called Fabric API, most mods use it.

### Prerequisites

Install Fabric for Minecraft 1.16.3: https://fabricmc.net/use/

Make sure to run Minecraft at least once for the mods folder to be generated.

### Installation

1. Download the latest version of the Accessibility Plus mod from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/accessibility-plus .
2. Download Fabric API for 1.16 from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files .
3. Open the Downloads folder and copy both files.
4. Press Win + R to open the Run box and type `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods` and press Enter.
5. Paste the files in this folder.
6. Open Minecraft and enable the Narrator goin to the accessibility options.
